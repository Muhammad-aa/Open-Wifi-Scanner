# Open-Wifi-Scanner
A script that scans for all open Wi-Fi networks within range.
This program works on both Linux and Windows OS's.
The open_networks_lister.py is the main program that scans for open Wi-Fi networks in range.

The wifi_networks_lister.py scans for all Wi-Fi networks within range. I recommened checking this out first before proceeding to the open_networks_lister.py
Please note that from a security perspective, open Wi-Fi networks are not encouraged as your data is sent as plain text instead of being encrypted. This means that if hackers intercept your data, theyâ€™ll be able to read and use it. 

This could be your password, banking credentials etc. I always tell people not to use it, if they can afford not to. If you must use it, consider using a reputable VPN and a plugin called HTTPS everywhere. 

This program is perfect for busy urban environments. Thanks!
